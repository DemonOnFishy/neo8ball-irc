Usage
-----

    usage: ircbot.sh [-c config]
           -c --config - a config file
    
    by default, if empty, the script assumes all the information can be found in the same directory as the script

Configure
---------

Edit the config.sh file and save it where you deem approprate.
Make sure to use the -c or --config flag if you don't leave the configuration in the default location--same directory as the ircbot.sh script.

For OpenWeatherMap, you need an API key; you can set it in the config.
Make sure it is exported.
By default the variable name is OWM_KEY.

For default weather location persistance and .nws search you need PERSIST_LOC defined in your environment.
You can set it in the config.
Make sure this value is exported
